# Evolutionary Computation

[repository](https://github.com/d9w/evolution/) | [website](https://d9w.github.io/evolution/)

This is a course on evolutionary computation. We focus specifically on the
evolution of agents with a final project on game playing agent evolution. The
syllabus can be found [here](syllabus.pdf). Classes are organized as individual
folders with presentations and Jupyter notebook exercises. To get started,
follow the instructions in [the first class](1_introduction).

## Course Outline

1. [Introduction](1_introduction)
2. [Genetic Algorithms](2_ga)
3. [Multi-Objective Evolution](3_moo)
4. [Evolution of programs, graphs, and networks](4_gp)
5. [Genetic representation and operator design](5_ops)
6. [Evolutionary Strategies](6_strategies)
7. [Evolution and behavior](7_behavior)
8. [Evolution with constraints](8_constraints)

## Project

The evaluation in this class will be based on a project. You will use your
choice of evolutionary methods to optimize an agent for playing games. More
information about the games and implementations will be here soon.
