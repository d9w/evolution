# Genetic representation and operator design

This class is an inverted class where students will prepare presentations on
different articles. These articles showcase a variety of genetic representations
and evolutionary operators such as specialized mutation, crossover, and
selection methods. The student presentations will be followed by a discussion
led by Sylvain Cussat-Blanc.
