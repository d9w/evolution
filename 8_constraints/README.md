# Evolution with constraints


This class is an invited lecture by [Élise
Vareilles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elise-vareilles-9785331/), professor at
ISAE-Supaero, on evolution with constraints. Élise presented in a live video
lecture the MOEA SPEA2, then an overview of constraint satisfaction programming
(CSP). Finally, she presented different ways that evolution can take
constraints into account, including some of her own work on genetic operators
specialized for CSP.
